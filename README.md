The idea behind PiiO is to have a single board expansion to implemnt any real-time interfcaing application without the need to buy different hardware for each application. This will allow for design and code reuse, i.e. the developer can use smae piece of code in many applications. this will reduce cost and effort and design time and hance ensures rapid prototypes and proof-of-concpts building.

PiiO Hats can be stacked up to 8-Hats for further expansion.

PiiO Hat is programmable via Python from Raspberry Pi side 

PiiO Hat only uses one SPI port from Raspbeery Pi expansion header and does not interact with other pins 

### Features
The board expands RPI capabilities with:
* 24-GPIO pins with 5V level
* Up to 6-PWM/Timer High resolution PWM output
* up to 6-UART ports
* UP to 2-CAN bus orts
* Up to 2-RS485 port signals 
* up-to 6-SPI ports
* up to 6-I2C ports
* up to 4-I2S ports 

* Up to 16-chnnel ADC with 1Msps rate with pin protection 
* Supply Votage 5V~24V
* Supply current 5A to provide power for PI 


### Applications
PiiO HAT is suitable for developing real-time interfaces with RPI for building applications like:
* Motion controllers for CNC and 3D pronter 
* Robotices application 
* Digital power converters, inverters and chargers [eg. Solar, Battery, Electric-vehicle, etc ]
* Home / building automation controller
* Motor control [Brushless, Indusction, etc]
* Industrail automation controllers 
* industrial RS485 or CAN applications
