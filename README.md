The idea behind PiiO is to have a single board expansion to implemnt any real-time interfcaing application without the need to buy different hardware for each application. 

The board expands RPI capabilities with:
* 24-GPIO pins with 5V~24V selectable level with protection
* Up to 6-PWM/Timer real-time output
* up to 6-UART ports
* UP to 2-CAN bus orts
* Up to 6-RS485 port signals 
* up-to 6-SPI ports
* up to 6-I2C ports
* up to 4-I2S ports 

* Up to 16-chnnel ADC with 1Msps rate with pin protection 
* Supply Votage 5V~24V
* Supply current 5A to provide power for PI 



PiiO HAT is suitable for developing real-time interfaces with RPI for building applications like:
* Motion controllers for CNC and 3D pronter 
* Robotices application 
* Digital power converters, inverters and chargers [eg. Solar, Battery, Electric-vehicle, etc ]
* Home / building automation controller
* Motor control [Brushless, Indusction, etc]
* Industrail automation controllers 
* industrial RS485 or CAN applications
