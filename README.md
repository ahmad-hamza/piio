* up to 6-UART ports
* up-to 6-SPI ports
* up to 6-I2C ports
* up to 4-I2S ports 
* Up to 6-PWM/Timer real-time output
* Up to 16-chnnel ADC with 1Msps rate with pin protection 
* Supply Votage 5V~24V
* Supply current 5A to provide power for PI 



PiiO HAT is suitable for developing real-time interfaces with RPI for building applications like:
